Here are the minimum data elements I would require to robustly test the Baseline Hypothesis in a physics/thermodynamics/ASHRAE-consistent way, with explicit justification and how each data item supports or undermines the hypothesis. I’ll keep to a conservative set that targets distinguishing “no substantial 7%+ savings possible due to mechanical/thermal limits” from “7%+ savings feasible via standard improvements,” and I’ll map each item to how it reduces ambiguity. Minimum Bare Data (core set)
CHWST (Chilled Water Supply Temperature setpoint and measured supply temperature)
Why needed: Determines condenser/evaporator duty, chiller part-load performance, and potential for COP improvement through CHWS reset.
Physics/thermo basis: CHWS setpoint and actual CHWS determine the evaporator approach and delta-T, which drive COP and kW/ton. Warming or resetting CHWS is a primary lever for energy reduction without hardware changes.
CHWRT (Chilled Water Return Temperature)
Why needed: Together with CHWST defines ΔT across the chiller condenser/evaporator; crucial for assessing heat transfer effectiveness and potential under/over cooling.
ASHRAE/NIST guidance links ΔT and external loading to energy efficiency and proper staging of multiple chillers.
CDWST (Condenser Water Temperature Setpoint)
Why needed: Sets the condenser-side condition; directly impacts compressor COP and fan duty in water-cooled or air-cooled plants.
Thermodynamics: Lower CDWST can improve COP up to a point; too low can cause inefficiencies or pump/flow issues. Essential to assess potential gains from condenser-side optimization.
CDWRT (Condenser Water Return Temperature)
Why needed: Completes the condenser-side ΔT calculation; informs tower/pump control effectiveness and potential for condenser-cooling optimization.
ASHRAE guidance: Proper condenser water temperature differential is a primary determinant of plant efficiency and peak performance.
Power (Total chiller plant electrical power, per unit and/or total, at representative operating points)
Why needed: Central to computing actual COP (kW/ton) and to quantify energy savings potential from operational changes.
Thermodynamics: Baseline energy use at different loads defines headroom for improvements and distinguishes genuine COP improvements from static performance.
Load (Chiller plant cooling load or tonnage delivered, or per-chiller load if available)
Why needed: Required to compute loading, staging efficiency, and to identify under/over-sizing or poor part-load performance.
ASHRAE/DOE context: Savings potential is highly load-dependent; knowing actual delivered load is essential to estimate potential 7%+ gains from controls and sequencing.
Flow (Water flow rate in CHW and, if relevant, CDW circuit)
Why needed (critical): Determines actual heat transfer effectiveness, verifies ΔT readings are physically plausible, and distinguishes flow-restriction or fouling from mere low load.
Physics/ASHRAE: Flow rate is a major factor in pump energy, ΔT across coils, and overall plant COP. Absence of flow data is a known source of ambiguity between “low-load/efficiency opportunity” vs. “flow restriction/mechanical issue.”
Optional (but strongly recommended as verification if available)
8) Outdoor ambient data (dry-bulb, wet-bulb, solar radiation) and occupancy/internal loads
Why: Enables weather-driven reset analysis and seasonality assessment, which are central to control optimization strategies.
Chiller/ST (Unit-level operating mode, part-load ratio, staging sequence, and chiller on/off state)
Why: Critical to attribute observed inefficiencies to control logic vs. mechanical faults; supports proper attribution of savings potential to controls and staging rather than hardware limits.
Delta-T across major heat transfer loops (e.g., ΔT across CHW and CDW coils)
Why: Direct indicator of heat transfer effectiveness and fouling/flow issues; helps validate whether an energy-saving strategy would be physics-limited or controllable via operational changes.
How these data items map to the Baseline Hypothesis testing
If CHWST, CHWRT, CDWST, CDWRT, Power, Flow, and Load are all available with consistent time alignment:
You can compute true COP across operating envelopes, identify mis-staged sequencing, quantify potential gains from resetting CHWS/CDW and optimizing tower/condenser operations, and distinguish mechanical limitations (e.g., flow restriction, fouling) from controllable inefficiencies.
A robust quantitative test of the Baseline Hypothesis can be performed by simulating standard efficiency measures (controls optimization, RCx-style tuning, minor setpoint adjustments) and estimating the achievable energy reduction given observed loads and measured ΔT/flow. If the resulting posterior probability for ≥7% savings remains low after accounting for all measured channels, you have stronger evidence in favor of the Baseline Hypothesis; if it rises, you have evidence against it.
Operational notes and verification steps
Ensure data provenance: timestamp alignment across all channels, units consistency (kW vs. MW, °C, L/s or GPM, etc.).
Validate measurement integrity: check for sensor drift, calibration status, and any negative readings (as you flagged earlier). Document any known data quality gaps.
Check for missing or inconsistent data windows (e.g., nighttime periods with zero or near-zero flow that could distort the analysis).
Provide a concise data quality score (e.g., percentage of records with valid flow, valid temperatures, and power readings) to accompany the Bare Data set.
Minimal reporting format for decision-ready use
A compact data summary showing for each metric: current average, 95th percentile, minimum, maximum, and a statement of data quality (valid/missing/calibrated).
A single combined COP curve across representative loads, with and without suggested control optimizations, explicitly showing estimated energy savings for ≥7% target under realistic constraints.
Clear caveats where data gaps exist (especially missing flow) and the corresponding impact on the confidence level for rejecting the Baseline Hypothesis.
If you want, I can create a minimal, checkable data template (CSV or JSON) containing exactly these fields, with placeholders for a few representative operating points, and a short calculation script to compute COP, headroom, and a preliminary 7% savings estimate.
